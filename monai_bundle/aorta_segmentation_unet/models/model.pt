# This is a placeholder file for the trained model weights
# The actual model weights (best_metric_model.pth) should be placed in this directory
# Model specifications:
# - 3D UNet with 1 input channel, 24 output classes
# - channels=(16, 32, 64, 128, 256), strides=(2, 2, 2, 2), num_res_units=2
# - Trained with DiceCELoss, Adam optimizer (lr=1e-4)
# - Input: CT scans with intensity range [-175, 250] HU
# - Output: 24-class segmentation (background + 23 anatomical regions)
